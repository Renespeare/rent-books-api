# Rent Books API - Generasi Gigih Capstone Project 
One of the problems with the low literacy rate in Indonesia is the unequal access to books. Many Indonesian people find it difficult to get books. As is the case, in one of the areas in Indonesia, the nearest bookstore is dozens of kilometers away. Therefore, along with the increasingly massive development of digital technology, we provide solutions so that people can borrow books and read them online. We provide Minimum Viable Product (MVP) on the back-end side, namely "Rent Books API".
